COMMANDS                                                                   MKPWD

NAME
    mkpwd - make password

INVOCATION
    mkpwd [OPTION ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Generates a 10-character pseudo-random password suitable for typing on a
    regular QWERTY keyboard.

OPTIONS
    -l L    Generate passwords of length L.

    -n N    Generate N passwords.

ISSUES
    Passwords should be avoided in favour of passkeys where possible, which are
    more secure than the former. When passwords are used, they should be long,
    high-entropy, and unique â€” no password should be used twice.
